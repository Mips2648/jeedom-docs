- Fix: **Remaining Time** info command for Husqvarna robots never updated.

  - **Height of cut** allowing to know and define the height of cut
  - **Headlight** allowing to know and define the lighting mode of the headlights
  - **Last report time** and **Next departure time**
  - **Schedule restriction** giving the reason for the exception on normal schedule
  - **Positions** containing the history of the last 50 positions of the robot (the commands **Last position**, **Latitude** and **Longitude** still exist and indicate the last known position)
- Addition of a widget for displaying the history of positions on a map to be applied to the **Positions** command (see documentation) (contribution from @t0urista)

## 2021-08-22

## 2021-07-12

- Added a configurable cron for updating Husqvarna Automowers in the plugin configuration.
- Added the possibility of selecting pause time (in minutes) in command *Pause schedule*. To have this option, you must delete the existing command on the device (do not delete the device), save and then use the function *Create missing commands * so that the command is recreated with the correct configuration. The scenarios will have to be adapted with the new command.
- Move plugin to "Nature" category

## 2021-03-14

- Fix version of a dependency due to a bug in the latest version of it (see <https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/commit/3112b7d75b1e5d65cb8fdfca7801606649044ed1#commitcomment-48226116>). If you installed the plugin and its dependencies after March 3, you probably need to rerun the dependency installation; if everything is working well for you it is not necessary.
