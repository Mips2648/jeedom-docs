# 2021-08-22

# 2021-07-12

- Added a configurable cron for updating Husqvarna Automowers in the plugin configuration.
- Added the possibility of selecting pause time (in minutes) in command *Pause schedule*. To have this option, you must delete the existing command on the device (do not delete the device), save and then use the function *Create missing commands * so that the command is recreated with the correct configuration. The scenarios will have to be adapted with the new command.
