# Description

Plugin to integrate all devices from Gardena Smart System (Water Control, sensor, irrigation control, power socket and Sileno mower) as well as Husqvarna Automower Connect robots.
It is possible to access device data, monitor them and perform actions (depending on the device, see below for more details)

> **Important**
>
> Husqvarna mowers require an "X" / "Automower Connect" model with internet connectivity. This plugin will not work with any other local technology, such as for example, but not exclusively, "Automower Connect@Home" which use bluetooth.

# Installation

In order to use the plugin, you must download, install and activate it like any Jeedom plugin.

> **Important**
>
> Debian 8 (Jessie) is no longer supported by Debian, the plugin will not work under Jessie because it is necessary to install dependencies which are no longer available on this version.
>
> If you tried to install the "Gardena Smart System" plugin, you must deactivate it before activating this one. Indeed, a problem in the "Gardena Smart System" plugin create a conflict with this plugin which could make Jeedom unavailable. This problem must be fixed in the other plugin, it is unfortunately impossible for me to avoid it.

# Plugin configuration

In the plugin configuration, you shall enter your username, password and application key to access the API.
You must also select the API you want to activate among the 2 possible options (both can be activated at the same time):

- Gardena Smart System
- Husqvarna Automower

You will find more information directly available on the plugin configuration page.

# Device synchronization and configuration

As soon as the plugin configuration is complete and correct, the plugin will synchronize the devices according to the activated API.
It will create the missing devices with their commands and update the commands of all connected devices.

The commands of the Gardena Smart System devices will be updated in real time, so there is no additional configuration to do.

Husqvarna Automowers will be updated according to the plugin configuration, by default every 2 minutes between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. **Please note** there is a limit of 10,000 updates per month imposed by Husqvarna.
A **Refresh** command exists to request manually an additional update.

> **Tip**
>
> The plugin will never delete a device in your Jeedom. If a jeedom device does not correspond to any device in your possession, please delete it manually.

In the device configuration page, there is a button to create the missing commands on it (in case you have deleted a command by mistake for example).
