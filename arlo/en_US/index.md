# Description

Plugin to control all Arlo devices like the cameras, the base station and the integrated siren.

All current models supported by the Arlo application (web or mobile) are supported by the plugin: Arlo, Arlo Pro, Pro2, Pro3, Ultra, Arlo Floodlight, Arlo Q, Arlo Go, Arlo Baby, Arlo Doorbell et Video Doorbell...

Here is an overview of the possibilities of the plugin:

- select mode: Activated, Deactivated or schedule but also all custom modes;
- Enable / disable each camera independently of each other (regardless of the current mode);
- trigger the siren integrated to the base station (or Pro3 and Ultra camera) and know its status;
- get the status of each camera:
  - connected or not
  - general status (inactive, alert, ...)
  - battery level (and if charging is in progress)
  - signal strength
  - if sound or motion detection is active
  - if sound or motion is detected
- take a snapshot (stored locally)
- record video (stored locally)
- view snapshots and videos
- start/stop recording stored in Arlo cloud
- view live streaming of your cameras
- control the light on compatible cameras
- control de siren on compatible cameras

# Installation

> **Important**
>
> Debian 8 (Jessie) is no longer supported by Debian, the plugin will not work under Jessie because it is necessary to install dependencies which are no longer available on this version.

In order to use the plugin, you must download, install and activate it like any Jeedom plugin.
Then you need to install dependencies.

# Configuration

Arlo does not allow simultaneous connections from one user to multiple interfaces: if you are logged into the app on one mobile, you will not be able to be on another mobile at the same time or on the web interface. If you connect to the web interface for example you will be automatically disconnected from the mobile app.
The plugin connects to the Arlo system as a standard user and will therefore be subject to the same constraint.

It is therefore necessary to create a user dedicated to the plugin, otherwise it will not work properly.

## 2-step authentication

Arlo is gradually enforcing the use of 2-step authentication.
Before creating a new Arlo user, it is important to know the following information:

- The plugin manages this via email with IMAP support only, so you will need a mailbox with IMAP access (it is sometimes blocked or not free so check before) and only supports authentication by _username_ /_password_ ; no MFA on the mail!
- The plugin must have direct access to the arlo user's mailbox, indeed the code for the TFA is requested by Arlo at each login! So if the daemon has to restart it must be able to retrieve the code itself.
- the plugin will only read the mail coming from *do_not_reply@arlo.com*; so even though it is recommended to have a dedicated mailbox and not an alias of an existing mailbox, this shouldn't be a problem; it will flag the emails as "read" in the box when done (and will no longer try to read them on the next start)
- the plugin will only search among the unread mails of the current day, in reverse chronological order (from the most recent to the oldest) and will skip all the mails sent before its last login.
- the language of the email is not important: the search for the TFA code will work regardless of the language of the email.

> **Tip**
>
> for Gmail, you must:
>
> - either activate _nonsecure_ applications if MFA is not active on the account
> - or create an _application password_ which will not require the MFA

After creating an email box for the plugin, you can go to the next step.

## Creating a Arlo user dedicated to the plugin

- For this, open <https://my.arlo.com> or open the mobile app;
- Click on &quot;Settings&quot; at the top right;
![Arlo settings](../images/settings.png "Arlo settings")

- Click on &quot;Allow access&quot; in the left menu and then on &quot;Add&quot; on the right.
![Arlo access](../images/access.png "Arlo access")

- Enter the requested information including a new email address (a gmail alias by adding +jeedom before @gmail.com for example will work however for 2-step authentication I recommend to use a dedicated email address for the plugin);
- **Select the Arlo devices** that the plugin will access;
- **Enable the option "Grant access rights"** to be able to change modes, start recording, take snapshots etc from Jeedom.
![Arlo account creation](../images/create.png "Arlo account creation")
- Click on &quot;Send an invitation&quot;
- You will receive a confirmation email to create your new Arlo account, simply follow the procedure.

> **Tip**
>
> Log out of &quot;My Arlo&quot;, open a &quot;private window&quot; on your browser or use another browser to create your second Arlo account.

## Plugin configuration

On the plugin configuration page:

- Enter your user (the new email address) and the associated Arlo password.
- If you have enabled 2-step authentication, enter the IMAP address of the mail server in the form _imap.server.com_ as well as the username and password of the associated mailbox (not necessary if TFA is not active)
- Start the daemon (if it does not start on its own)

If the connection information are correct, the status should turn green and the plugin will start to synchronize your previously shared devices.

On this page, it is also possible to configure the retentions rules of snapshots and records, these rules allow the plugin to automatically delete the oldest medias (saved locally).

# Usage

If the plugin is correctly configured (see previous step), you should see the list of Arlo devices that you shared when creating the plugin account.

It is not possible to manually create a device. The devices are automatically created or updated by the plugin during synchronization with the Arlo system. Synchronization will be done automatically at least once a day, if necessary it is possible to start a synchronization manually via the device management screen.

![Devices](../images/devices.png "Devices")

The plugin will never automatically delete a device; if you no longer have the device or if you have removed the access rights for the plugin, it is recommended to manually delete the corresponding device in Jeedom.
If you add a new device or change the modes via the Arlo application, it is recommended to do a manual synchronization to update the plugin configuration immediately; otherwise, this will be done during the next automatic synchronization.

> **Tip**
>
> This obviously does not affect the values of the commands such as the selected mode or motion or sound detection which are updated in real time.

For most of the devices there is no specific configuration, the name of the device will be the one defined in Arlo platform, but remember to assign the parent object, the category and activate it.

For camera devices, it is possible to configure an action command of the Mail or Telegram plugin. If this one is configured, the plugin will send a message, including the snapshot, as soon as a new one is available.

# Compatible devices

It is possible that some specific commands to certain models are not (yet) available, in this case please contact me via the forum for more information.

## The base station for Arlo pro, pro2, pro3 & ultra

The base station has one action command by available mode: Activated, Deactivated and each custom mode and an info command for the active mode.

The widget is Jeedom's default one:

![Flow](../images/streaming.png "Flow")

It is a continuous video stream, the camera and the stream will stop when the window will be closed.

# The library

When a local video recording is made or when a capture is taken by the plugin or received from Arlo in the event of motion detection, these can be viewed via the library tools of each camera.
