# The plugin allow to retrieve data of an Solaredge inverter. The plugin refresh data every 5 minutes with a cron.

Global overview (current power and production history)

# Installation

## > **Tip**
>
> In order to use the plugin you have to download,install and activate it as any other Jeedom plugin.

![Plugin configuration](../images/plugin_config.png "Plugin configuration")

The plugin use a "cron5" to get the data every 5 minutes. You can decide to deactivate it and to refresh your device manually or another mean but it's useless to refresh data more frequently.

> **Important**
>
> Solaredge allow only 300 calls/day on their API; refreshing data every 5 minutes during 24 hours will trigger 288 calls (so below the limit of 300 calls). If you decide to manage the refresh with another mean, take care to not bypass this limit.
In the plugin configuration, it is possible to provide a command to get sunrise and sunset time as provided by the "Weather" or "HÃ©liotrope" plugin. This will allow to pause the task that get data between those time as there isn't any solar energy production overnight ;-). If no commands are provided, the task will pause between 10pm and 4am (not configurable yet).
